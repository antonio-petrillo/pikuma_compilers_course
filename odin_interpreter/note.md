# Should continue?
I've made this interpreter without following the instructions in the lessons, I already knew how to build a tree walk interpreter and I wanted to try to build all by myself.  
That said, the two language are quite different and continue to refine my implementation will slow down to much, specially because the most interesting parts for me are on the last part of the course.  
Maybe after completed the course I can go back and implement the virtual machine in `odin` (up to the parser everything should be fine).
